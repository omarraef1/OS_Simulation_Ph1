This directory contains the following tests:

test_P_forever.c: Semaphore is never V'ed.
test_P_invalid_args: Call P with invalid args.
test_V_higher_priority: V'ed higher priority process should pre-empt.
test_V_invalid_args: Call V with invalid args.
test_V_lower_priority: V'ed lower priority process does not pre-empt.
test_create_invalid_args: Create sem with invalid args.
test_create_max: Exactly P1_MAXSEM semaphores can be created.
test_everything: Comprehensive test.
test_free: Repeatedly create and free semaphores without running out.
test_free_invalid_args: Free with invalid arguments.
test_free_with_blocked: Free a semaphore with processes blocked on it.
test_multiple_blocked: Multiple processes blocked on the same semaphore.
test_multiple_sems: Multiple processes blocked on individual semaphores.
test_nested: Single process P's nested semaphores.
test_p_v: One process P's on semaphore then another process V's it.
test_races: Multiple processes P and V same semaphore w/ time slicing.
test_semP: Semaphore initial value is 3, P it three times.
test_v_p: One process V's on semaphore then another process P's it.


**
Please note the sample output for test- test_races under the results directory.
Due to clock issues, the sequence of quitting might be different.
On Gradescope, the quitting sequence is sorted and then graded so different
sequences would still pass as long as all processes quit properly and the test
prompts "TEST PASSED".
